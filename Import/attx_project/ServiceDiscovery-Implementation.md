## Consul in Practice

Service Discovery became an important component to most environments who canâ€™t be satisfied with static and manual configuration of components.

### Registering a Service

### (De)Registering a Service

### Making Use of Registered Services

### Storing Key/Value

What would be the best way to store this?

* Using one key per root and storing all the root tree as JSON object
* Using key per 1-level children - and storing all grandchildren as JSON
* or storing each grand children per key

In other words:

* /foo {json}
* /foo/bar {json}
* /foo/bar/zar {json}
