# Workflow Component

The ATTX Workflow Component provides a configurable framework with the main purpose of ingesting, processing and distributing data and at the same time keeping track of the provenance, workflow/pipelines and activities/scheduled jobs used to map and enhance/enrich the information.

**Github Repository: **[**workflow-component**](https://github.com/ATTX-project/workflow-component)

The Workflow Component consists of two main artifacts:

* ETL Engine/Artifact - more details about [ETL Artifacts](ETL-Artifacts.md) we make use of [UnifiedViews](https://unifiedviews.eu/) as an ETL tool along side custom [plugins](Unified-Views-plugins.md).
* Workflow API - more details about the [WF-API](WF-API.md)
