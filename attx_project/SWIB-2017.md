## Proposal

Working title: Data Provenance in a Distributed Environment: A Semantic Broker Approach

Provenance is especially important for brokering type of systems
Provenance represents the metadata that describes all the actions performed on a particular data set - [insert provenance reference here]
The basic concepts come from ProvO: Entity, Agent and Activity - list other activities and how we have extended and to make it fit our application, 
thus designing an application-type of ontology
Architecture - Distributed Architecture presents the challenge, how to keep track of the provenance information given that the actions happen all over the place
and we opted for implementing a provenance service where we can push and pull provenance information from different components in the broker
    - two modes of provenance, hence a hybrid approach
        prescriptive: what happend is described by the plan of the component
        descriptive: what happend as described by the component itself

Such provenance is exposed through the components of the broker, and there is inception (provenance about the generation of provenance) and it is usable by any client,
provenance browser !!!!???
