# Workflow Component

The ATTX Workflow Component provides a configurable framework with the main purpose of ingesting, processing and distributing data and at the same time keeping track of the provenance, workflow/pipelines and activities/scheduled jobs used to map and enhance/enrich the information.

The Workflow Component consists of:

* ETL Engine/Artifact - more details about [ETL Artifacts](ETL-Artifacts.md) we make use of [UnifiedViews](https://unifiedviews.eu/) as an ETL tool;
* Custom UnifiedViews [plugins](Unified-Views-plugins.md);
* UVProvovenance service - more details about the [UVProvovenance-API](UVProvovenance-API.md).
